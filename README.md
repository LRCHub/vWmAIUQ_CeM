La, la la, la la la la la
La, la la, la la la la la
I don’t need no 123 not
Bourgeoisie, I’ll step in
Know just how to make a scene,
just me myself my best friends
Uh huh I like it,
it’s simple as that
That’s right, uh huh
I like it I keep coming back
I don't need nobody tryna
tell me how to run it
Found myself some baddies bout
to turn it to a hundred
Uh huh, they like it,
it’s simple as that
That’s right uh huh,
they like it,
they keep coming back
Ohh We-ee-ee ain’t flexin’
babe we do what we do
Wanna pull up on us?
Check in at the gate
and come thru
We can run it run it run it
no this ain’t a debut
Love me once
I know you’ll love me twice
Love me once
the naughty turns to nice
La, la la, la la la la la
I don’t need no cookie cutter
perfect ordinary
Can find me under ride or die
inside that dictionary
Babe uh huh, they like it,
it’s simple as that
That’s right uh huh,
they like it,
they keep coming back
Ohh We-ee-ee ain’t flexin’
babe we do what we do
Wanna pull up on us?
Check in at the gate
and come thru
We can run it run it run it
no this ain’t a debut
Love me once
I know you’ll love me twice
Love me once
the naughty turns to nice
Ohh We-ee-ee ain’t flexin’
babe we do what we do
Wanna pull up on us?
Check in at the gate
and come thru
We can run it run it run it
no this ain’t a debut
Love me once
I know you’ll love me twice
Love me once
the naughty turns to nice
